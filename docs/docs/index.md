DEA is a multi-purpose Discord Bot mainly known for it's infamous Cash AND Item System, allowing you to buy crates and win prizes such as rare weapons or knives, and trade them with other users. 

This bot is also capable of being an excellent moderation bot for all needs. Multiple commands such as kick, ban, mute are available at your disposition. One of the most acclaimed features of DEA is the automatic unmutes after the specified amount of time with mute evasion prevention. 

Contrary to nearly all public bots, almost everything is customizable. You may set a custom prefix, moderator role and even things such as mod log channels.

If you have any issues when setting up the bot, do not hesitate to join the official DEA support channel by clicking on the link below:
